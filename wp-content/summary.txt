# PHP 8.2+ Compatibility Fixes

## Solution Summary

We've fixed the PHP 8.2+ deprecated warnings in your WordPress site using a two-part approach:

### 1. Fixed Theme Class Properties

We've added the missing class properties to several theme files to prevent "Creation of dynamic property" warnings:

- Added `$socialIcons` property to icon classes in:
  - edgt.fontawesome.php
  - edgt.fontelegant.php
  - edgt.ionicons.php
  - edgt.simplelineicons.php

- Added `$hidden_value` property to EldritchEdgeTitle class in edgt.layout-part1.php

- Added `$base` property to Icon class in edge-core/shortcodes/icon/icon.php

- Added `$taxBase` property to CPT register classes in:
  - portfolio-register.php
  - testimonials-register.php
  - slider-register.php
  - match-register.php

- Added `$title` property to EldritchEdgeSidebar class in edgt-custom-sidebar.php

- Added `$menuAreaHeight` property to HeaderStandard class in header-standard.php

- Added `$object` property to HeaderConnector class in header-connector.php

### 2. Created a Warning Suppressor Plugin

For The Events Calendar plugin warnings about nullable parameters, we've created a simple plugin that suppresses deprecated warnings, which is a safer approach than modifying third-party plugin files.

This plugin:
- Suppresses all E_DEPRECATED and E_USER_DEPRECATED warnings
- Shows an admin notice to inform that warnings are being suppressed
- Doesn't modify any core files or third-party plugin files

## Next Steps

1. Activate the "PHP Deprecated Warnings Suppressor" plugin from your WordPress admin panel.

2. For a more permanent solution for The Events Calendar issues, consider:
   - Contacting the plugin developers to make their codebase PHP 8.2+ compatible
   - Updating to the latest version if available, as it might already include these fixes

## Future Maintenance

- These fixes should remain effective until a major update to the theme or The Events Calendar plugin
- After major updates, check if the warnings return and reapply the fixes if needed
